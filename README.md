Have you ever wondered how you can seamlessly add full-sized Desktop Cards with a **full-link** 16x PCIe connection to a laptop with MXM3.0 slot **while** using its internal display? Well, I've been wondering for some time, too.

This repo will document my findings and the whole process of investigation and design of an adapter that **aims** to do that.

(honestly this will not be a meaningful repo before I got myself something, like, Dell Precision M4600? So I won't probably tag this with proper, descriptive tags. PLZZZ GIMME MONEYYYYY!)
